<h3>geolocation provider</h3>
<div>
  <p>
     One of the providers is geolocation, which determines
     the country for the current user and provides it in variables.
  </p>
  <p> At the root config level you must specify the global properties
     of the geolocation provider, as follows:
      "providers": {
           "geolocation" : {
               "dictionaryPath": "the path (relative or absolute)",
           } 
      }
  <p> 
   It is possible to activate geolocation providers on each individual server.
   Inside the <span>server</span> or <span>hostServers</span> you can specify the <span>providers</span>
   and provide the following description:
   "providers" : [{
       "name" : "geolocation",
       "urls" : "optional urls as described below"
   }]
 </p>
 <p>   <span>urls</span> is a list of urls
         urls can be separated with spaces or semicolon.
         If urls are not specified, all urls will be valid.
 </p>
 <p>   Each url can be represented as a specific url: "/api/v1/users"
       or contain wild characters: "/api/**/index?.*"
 </p>
 <p> ? means any single character. For example,"/api/v??" can be used
    for "/api/v01", "/api/vaa", ...
 </p>
 <p> * means any (zero or many) characters and can be used inside each
      url part once (if you use many, the others
    will be considered just as ?).
 </p>
 <p> ** can be used only once for a whole url, meaning that it can
    cover many url parts. If you specify some **, only the first one
    will be used as **, the other ** will be considered just as *?.
 </p>
 <p> for a url part, you can also specify regex in `` brackets or
    starting with ^. For example, "/api/`v[0-9]+`" stands for "/api/v1",
    "/api/v2","/api/v10", ... 
  </p>
 <p>    <span>params</span> are specific for each processor
 </p>
 <p>
  "!" at the beginning defines the exclusion.
  It is also possible to exclude some urls from defined previously.
  "*.properties; !/private/ ; *.txt" - in this example all *.properties
  are chosen except for the private folder, and all *.txt files
  without any exceptions.
