 <p>
   Processors provide the opportunity to change the processings for 
   specific urls with their custom implementation in golang.
  </p>
  <p> 
   It is possible to activate processors on each individual server.
   Inside the <span>server</span> or <span>hostServers</span> you can specify the <span>templates</span>
   and provide the following description:
   "processors" :[{
       "name" : "name of the registered processor",
       "urls" : "urls as described below",
       "params": ["param 1","param 2",...]
   }, ...]
 </p>
 <p>   <span>urls</span> is a list of urls
         urls can be separated with spaces or semicolon
 </p>
 <p>   Each url can be represented as a specific url: "/api/v1/users"
       or contain wild characters: "/api/**/index?.*"
 </p>
 <p> ? means any single character. For example,"/api/v??" can be used
    for "/api/v01", "/api/vaa", ...
 </p>
 <p> * means any (zero or many) characters and can be used inside each
      url part once (if you use many, the others
    will be considered just as ?).
 </p>
 <p> ** can be used only once for a whole url, meaning that it can
    cover many url parts. If you specify some **, only the first one
    will be used as **, the other ** will be considered just as *?.
 </p>
 <p> for a url part, you can also specify regex in `` brackets or
    starting with ^. For example, "/api/`v[0-9]+`" stands for "/api/v1",
    "/api/v2","/api/v10", ... 
  </p>
 <p>    <span>params</span> are specific for each processor
 </p>
 <p> There are some ready processors: "hidefile" and "template".
   For example, to hide some files from access, you can write as follows:
   "processors": [
       {
          "name": "hidefile",
          "urls": "*.properties; /private/"
       } 
   ]
   This option will hide files having extension "properties" or 
   inside the folder "private".
 </p>
 <p>
  "!" at the beginning defines the exclusion.
  It is also possible to exclude some urls from defined previously.
  "*.properties; !/private/ ; *.txt" - in this example all *.properties
  are chosen except for the private folder, and all *.txt files
  without any exceptions. 
 </p>
