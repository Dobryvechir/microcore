<h3>Providers</h3>
<div>
 <p>
   Providers provide the opportunity to calculate specific
   data for a template, for example, geolocation by ip,
   user name, user id, authorization and so on.
   Providers can be written using your custom implementation in golang.
  </p>
  <p>
     One of the providers is geolocation, which determines
     the country for the current user and provides it in variables.
     See <a href="geolocation.html">geolocation</a> for more details.
  </p>
  <p> At the root config level you can specify the global properties
     of the provider (they are specific for each provider).
      "providers": {
           "name of provider 1" : {
               "parameter 1": "value",
               "parameter 2": "value"
               ...
           } 
           ... 
      }
  <p> 
   It is possible to activate providers on each individual server.
   Inside the <span>server</span> or <span>hostServers</span> you can specify the <span>providers</span>
   and provide the following description:
   "providers" : [{
       "name" : "name of the registered processor",
       "urls" : "urls as described below",
       "folder": "optional base folder name, if the provider is connected with folders and server base folder should not be used"
       "params": ["param 1","param 2",...]
   }]
 </p>
 <p>   <span>urls</span> is a list of urls
         urls can be separated with spaces or semicolon.
         If urls are not specified, all urls will be valid.
 </p>
 <p>   Each url can be represented as a specific url: "/api/v1/users"
       or contain wild characters: "/api/**/index?.*"
 </p>
 <p> ? means any single character. For example,"/api/v??" can be used
    for "/api/v01", "/api/vaa", ...
 </p>
 <p> * means any (zero or many) characters and can be used inside each
      url part once (if you use many, the others
    will be considered just as ?).
 </p>
 <p> ** can be used only once for a whole url, meaning that it can
    cover many url parts. If you specify some **, only the first one
    will be used as **, the other ** will be considered just as *?.
 </p>
 <p> for a url part, you can also specify regex in `` brackets or
    starting with ^. For example, "/api/`v[0-9]+`" stands for "/api/v1",
    "/api/v2","/api/v10", ... 
  </p>
 <p>    <span>params</span> are specific for each processor
 </p>
 <p>
  "!" at the beginning defines the exclusion.
  It is also possible to exclude some urls from defined previously.
  "*.properties; !/private/ ; *.txt" - in this example all *.properties
  are chosen except for the private folder, and all *.txt files
  without any exceptions.
