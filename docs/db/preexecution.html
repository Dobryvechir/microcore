1. INTRODUCTION
It is possible to pre-execute some queries or upload data from .csv files (in specific formats)
in advance at the time when microcore restarts. 
If you want to do so, a special folder must be created anywhere in the system available for microcore,
we will call this folder a root preexecution folder.
The folder must contain subfolders by the name of connection. 
Inside those folders there must be either folders V1, V2, V3, ... where the number means the version
or folders common..., which are executed all the time at the start of microcore.
Queries are executed only once. So, if you wish to execute new query, you should create a new folder V<number>.
Inside those queries can be subfolders and queries inside them are executed in the alphabetic order of
the file names. 
If the file name contains .postgre.sql or .oracle.sql, or any other .[alphabetical lower-case word].sql,
queries are executed only for specific sql. 
The last executed version is stored in the database.

2. PREEXECUTION MANAGEMENT THRU VARIABLES
The following variables are used to manage the pre-execution:
To store the last version, a special table is created, which is determined by the variable as follows:
DB_LOCAL_STORAGE_TABLE=R_STORAGE_LOCAL(id varchar primary,name varchar)

To list all connections where the pre-execution must take place, you need to specify the 
variable DB_CONNNECTION_INIT as follows, for example:
DB_CONNECTIONS_INIT=TM, PM
If the above variable is empty, pre-execution does not take place at all (it is not an error).
But if this variable is set
The following variable specify the root preexecution folder mentioned in the introduction above. 
DB_ROOT_PREEXECUTION_FOLDER=<folder name>
Each connection must be described as follows (it is not only for prexecution, but also for the work
with database in general - you can read in detail in ./connections.html:
DB_CONNECTION_TM=oracle,<init string>
DB_CONNECTION_PM=postgre,<init string>

3. VERSIONS USED TO PREVENT REPEATED EXECUTIONS
Inside the root preexecution folder must be subfolders called the same as connection names.
And inside those folder must be folders with names V<version>, for example, V1, V2, V3,...
or folders started with prefix "common". Scripts in folders started with prefix "common" are executed
always. 
For the convenience version can consist of up to 4 parts separated by dot (.), dash(-) or some
other allowed separator. 
For example, you can organize the following folders, which will be executed in the order as follows:
V0.0.0.1
V0.0.1
V0.0.2
V1
V1.0
V1.1
V2.2
V2.2.3

The first version can be full zero. (V0 or V0.0 or V0.0.0 or V0.0.0.0 are never executed).
There is also one limitation:
Each number must be within the range of 0 to  65535
So, the maximum allowed version is V65535.65535.65535.65535
The first letter V can be in either upper or lower case (V or v).
Separators can be any strings which are not digits and allowed in file name.
For example, 
  v---1---0---Folder-where-the-initial-sqls-are-stored
is a valid folder name with version 1.0

4. LOGGING

You can log the preexecution as follows:
There is a special variable, which determines the logging level
DVLOG_PREEXECUTION_LEVEL=...
By default, it has none level.
The following levels are used:
none - no messages are logged. At the same time, the error is returned out of the preexecution module and 
        can be logged there. This is the default behaviour.
error - only error messages are shown in log. 
warning - in addition, folders with versions are logged
info - in addition, each file name executed is logged, every file passed or omitted is logged
details - in addition, each sql in .sql file is logged and table names in .csv files
debug - in addition, each sql due to .csv is logged
trace - in addition, every detail is logged
