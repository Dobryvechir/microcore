The microcore can work with many databases simultaneously.
You must describe the connection to each database.
Each connection to a specific database must have a unique name.
For example, TM, PM, ... .
When any sql is executed, the corresponding connection name is specified.
There is a pool of connections for each specific connection.
Each connection must be described as follows:
DB_CONNECTION_<connection name>=<database name>,<init string>
For example:
DB_CONNECTION_TM=oracle,<init string>
DB_CONNECTION_PM=postgre,postgres://postgres@localhost/u32?sslmode=disable
DB_CONNECTION_MY=mysql,user:password@/dbname
As for init string, you can consult the specific golang sql driver.
You must connect the driver by yourself in the main go module you use.
In microcore/src/main you can learn how to connect postgress and oracle drivers.
