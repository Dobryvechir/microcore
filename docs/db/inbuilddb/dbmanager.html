  dvdbmanager.CreateOrUpdateByConditionsAndUpdateFields(tableName string, rowRecord *dvevaluation.DvVariable, conditions []string, fields []string) (*dvevaluation.DvVariable, error)
ACTION:
  This function has a new record and compares it with the old record based on id, 
and depending on the conditions, it can either replace partially or fully, or do nothing or clear some fields.
    all changes must be transactional, that is, noone can read write a record with the same id until the operation completes.
INPUT:
  tableName - the name of the table as usual,
  rowRecord - a new record for this table   
  conditions - some conditions to be checked, if none of them is met, no changes are made in the table.
  fields - fields which must be updated.
  For each row of task conditions must be a corresponding line in the task fields. If their length is not equal, it is error.
  conditions can have some special values: NEW, DEFAULT. NEW must be on the first place, DEFAULT must be on the last place.
  All other conditions must be between them, however both NEW and DEFAULT are optional.
  Conditions are checked line by line and the if the first condition is met, the operation is fulfilled according to this condition.
  If NEW is absent, it means that if there is no record with such id in the database, we do nothing. 
  If NEW is present and there is no record with such id, the whole rowRecord becomes a new record in the database and nothing more.
  Fields are not important in this case.
  If DEFAULT is not present and no conditions are met, no change is done in the database.
  If DEFAULT is present, but no conditions are met, then this fields are applied.

  Fields in general means only the comma-separated list of fields to be taken from the old record, but if ! is on the first place,
   it means that no changes from rowRecord should be applied, but these fields must be cleared in the old record.
  If ^ is on the first place, the list is to the contrary, contains only fields that must be taken from the new record. 

OUTPUT:
  *dvevaluation.DvVariable the resulted record saved. If the record was deleted and not restored by this operation, then nil is returned.
  error any error happening during this operation.
