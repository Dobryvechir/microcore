There is a special table created for each database connection to store 
some string values by keys. Dvserver uses this for its own purpose, but your application
can also use it.
In particular, the following variables are stored by microcore itself:
DB_PREEXECUTE_VERSION_TM = the last stored version when preexecution is made.
If you wish to preexecute from the beginning, you can remove this variable.
