There is a special table created for each database connection to store 
some string values by keys. Dvserver uses this for its own purpose, but your application
can also use it.
In particular, the following variables are stored by microcore itself:
DB_PREEXECUTE_VERSION_TM = the last stored version when preexecution is made.
If you wish to preexecute from the beginning, you can remove this variable.

The data must be in UTF8 format. If not so, the check and correction
are done automatically. There is one variable, which allows to change this
default behavior: DB_DATA_UTF8_CHECK
If it is not set or set incorrectly, the behavior is the default (check and correction
of all UTF8-illegal characters). It can take some values changing this default behavior:
NONE, STRICT, CHECK_ONLY. NONE means no check of UTF8 characters. It should be used only
when the database encoding is not UTF8. STRICT means that error will be generated if there are incorrect
characters and the operation will be cancelled. CHECK_ONLY means that only check will be done,
but no correction (if the database is UTF8 it probably means that the error will be generated at the
database level).
