    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Templates provide the opportunity to connect the static content
            with the environment variables and custom variables with their custom implementation in golang.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to activate templates on each individual server.
            Inside the <span>server</span> or <span>hostServers</span> you can specify the <span>templates</span>
            and provide the following description:
            "processors" : [{
            "name" : "template",
            "urls" : "urls, as described in <a href="providers.html">providers</a>, for example, **/route.js",
            "folder": "optional base folder, by default, server's base folder",
            "params": ["a" | "g" | "p" | ""]
            }]
        </p>
        <pre>
     Note: the first parameter in params is the default option as follows:
     "a" - apply only variable processing
     "g" -apply as well as golang template
     "p" -apply as well as place providers (not finished yet)
     "" - empty, do not apply templates at all
        </pre>
        <p>
            It is important that the file starts with a comment of any style (single line, multiline, HTML comment)
            and the first word in the template must be "template" + option as described above ("g", "p" or "")
        <p>

    </div>
