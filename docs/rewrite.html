1. Make abstract interface to url conversion (for rewrite in mind) in dvurl
- If anything from regexp is inserted $1, $2 and so on is used to insert
previous values
- regexp can be used in the url part
- * can be used in the url part
- foresee the return part, to include expression substitutions with precompiled
structure with 2 brackets
2. Remake rewrite to use dvurl package, condition and options
-. Add condition (which may be specified for rewrite), make it possible
   to specify any condition, including regular expressions
-. Make possibility to throw 301, 302,404 redirect in rewrite
- in conditions and options variables able can be declared on the config level
and which at the immediate execution level
- Check that 302 redirect is send to the frontend, and is not done
automatically
3. instead of proxyName set extraServerHeaders:[{key:"",value:"",condition:""}]
and inside them variables can be used
 - check that redirection works properly

4. Implement universal content-delivery that it can be adjusted to any
such conditions as frontend/backend proxy
- universal security
- universal access to dbaas
- universal cache
- universal structure to CRUD with specific parameters
- universal config description for content-delivery
5. Praise the Lord!
