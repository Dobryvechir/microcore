<pre>
Make conversions with variables
{
   "error_message"  a message to the user in case any functionality below fails
   "parse" map of string to {
         "var": string, the name of the source variable
         "evaluation": int, the number of brackets ({{ }}) to evaluate expression,
               if 0, no evaluation, otherwise, the number of brackets
       }
       for each key-value pair, the source specified in var value is parsed
       as json and stored in the variable with the name of the key,
       if the evaluation is not 0 (0 is the default), the source is evaluated
       before parsing to json
   "read" map of string to {<a href="json-source.html">json-source</a>}, for each key-value pair,
       reading json at specific path, filtering, sorting according common rules
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "to_integer" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the variable
      in the value is evaluated to integer with regard to current environment
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "transform" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the expression
      in the value is evaluated with regard to current environment
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "clone" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the json
      in the value is cloned
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "default_string" map of string to string, for each key-value pair,
        if the variable by key name is not defined, it is assigned
         a string value
   "default_any" map of string to string, for each key-value pair,
        if the variable by key name is not defined, it is assigned
         a value of any kind (number, boolean, json)
   "find" map of string to {
           "reg-expr": "string"
           "group": "string"
           "def-value": "string"
           "source": "string" required
           "is-all": true/false
           "count": int
         }
       for each key-value pair, the search is made for the variable by the source name
          by regular expression defined in "reg-expr".
       If the result has not been found, the "def-value" is used.
       If "is-all" is true, the result is the array of strings (if group is "0", "1","2",..)
              or array of array of strings (with all submatches) if group is not a number.
       If "is-all" is true and "count" is greater than zero, the result for n-th
       search is returned
       The result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "replace" map of string to {
           "reg-expr": "string"
           "source": "string"
           "replacement": "string"
           "literal": true/false
         }
       for each key-value pair, the search is made for the variable by the source name
          by regular expression defined in "reg-expr".
       If "literal" is false, and the replacement contains $1, ${1}, $2, ${2} they are used
        as the places where old values are reused
       The replacement is made and the result is stored in the variable
       specified by the key.
    "increase_version" map of string to {
           "var": "string"
           "limit": integer
           "def_version": string
         }
       for each key-value pair, the version (like 1.0.10) from the
       variable with the name of "var" is increased
       and the result is stored in the variable specified by the key.
       The "limit" specifies the point of increase at the next level
        (for example, 1.0.99 + 1 = 1.1.0 if the limit is 100)
       It is optional, default is 100. This value is not applied to the first
       number in the version.
       The "def_version" is used if the variable "var" does not contain a valid
        version ("N. ... .N, examples of valid versions: 1.0.0.0.1, 1.0.19, 1.2, 2, 34, 34.1)
    "remove_vars" array of string, removes variables from the environment (by name)
    "create_object" map of strings to map of strings to strings, creates the object based
      on map of strings to strings and stored at the variable having the name of the key of the primary map
    "create_array" map of strings to array of strings, creates the array based
      on array of strings and stored at the variable having the name of the key of the primary map
    "concat_objects" concatenates several objects into a new object
    {
       "sources" array of strings specifying variables with objects
       "dst" string, variable name to store the result
    }
    "object_by_array" creates object by array
      {
          "src", {<a href="json-source.html">json-source</a>}, the source of information
          "dst", string, where to write the code
          "key", string, expression for the key
          "value", string, expression for the value
          "key_policy", int, policy in case of error for key
                   0-skip, 1-empty string, 2-raise error, 3-null
          "value_policy", int, policy in case of error for value
                   0-skip, 1-empty string, 2-raise error, 3-null
      }
    "object_by_object" creates object by object
      {
          "src", {<a href="json-source.html">json-source</a>}, the source of information
          "dst", string, where to write the code
          "key", string, expression for the key
          "value", string, expression for the value
          "key_policy", int, policy in case of error for key
                   0-skip, 1-empty string, 2-raise error, 3-null
          "value_policy", int, policy in case of error for value
                   0-skip, 1-empty string, 2-raise error, 3-null
      }
      For each item within object you can use variables as follows:
       "this" is item itself
        if item is object, all its keys are available
        if item is array, keys are "0", "1", "2",...
        Otherwise, "_key" contains the key, "_value" contains the value
    "remove_by_keys" creates object by array
      {
          "src", {<a href="json-source.html">json-source</a>}, the source of information
          "dst", string, where to write the code
          "keys", array of strings to be deleted
      }
    "replace_text" replaces the text by a given map of rules (replacements)
    {
       "src", string, a source of text
       "dst", string, variable name to store the results
       "rules", object variable name containing the map of replacements
    }
}
Example:
var:{"clone":{"CLONED_A":"A"},"replace":{"source":"A","reg-expr":"a(x+)b","replacement":"${1}cd"}}
Note: all variables can contain the following parts in the name:
    [level][variable name][path]
    [level] and [path] are optional. [level] can be "global" or "request" or "session" or "_" or "$" or number (if it is the number,
    it is the number of closures beyond the current environment). "global" means that the change
    is made at the level of global variables and this will effect the following http requests.
    "request" level is the starting level at which the request variables were stored.
    [path] is useful only if the variable is json, and this is the path inside json
    Examples: "Global:M2M_TOKEN", "request:URL", "8:MAINJSON.0.name"
    When variable is read, it is also assumed that
    A) if it is in single quotes, it is a plain string,
    not taken from the environment.
    Example: "'key'" is evaluated as a string 'key' and it is not taken from the environment
    B) if the [level] is "_", it is considered as the value to be converted into json
    C) if the [level] is "$", it is considered as the expression to be evaluated
