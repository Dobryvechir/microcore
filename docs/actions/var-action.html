Make conversions with variables
{
   "parse" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the value is parsed
        as json and stored in the variable with the name of the key
   "read" map of string to {<a href="json-source.html">json-source</a>}, for each key-value pair,
       reading json at specific path, filtering, sorting according common rules
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "transform" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the expression
      in the value is evaluated with regard to current environment
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "clone" map of string to string, for each key-value pair, the json
      in the value is cloned
       and the result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "default_string" map of string to string, for each key-value pair,
        if the variable by key name is not defined, it is assigned
         a string value
   "default_any" map of string to string, for each key-value pair,
        if the variable by key name is not defined, it is assigned
         a value of any kind (number, boolean, json)
   "find" map of string to {
           "reg-expr": "string"
           "group": "string"
           "def-value": "string"
           "source": "string" required
           "is-all": true/false
           "count": int
         }
       for each key-value pair, the search is made for the variable by the source name
          by regular expression defined in "reg-expr".
       If the result has not been found, the "def-value" is used.
       If "is-all" is true, the result is the array of strings (if group is "0", "1","2",..)
              or array of array of strings (with all submatches) if group is not a number.
       If "is-all" is true and "count" is greater than zero, the result for n-th
       search is returned
       The result is stored in
       the variable with the name of the key
   "replace" map of string to {
           "reg-expr": "string"
           "source": "string"
           "replacement": "string"
           "literal": true/false
         }
       for each key-value pair, the search is made for the variable by the source name
          by regular expression defined in "reg-expr".
       If "literal" is false, and the replacement contains $1, ${1}, $2, ${2} they are used
        as the places where old values are reused
       The replacement is made and the result is stored in the variable
       specified by the key.
}
Example:
var:{"clone":{"CLONED_A":"A"},"replace":{"source":"A","reg-expr":"a(x+)b","replacement":"${1}cd"}}
