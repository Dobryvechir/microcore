<h1>Json source</h1>
<pre>
The json source is used in many actions and describes the operations to take the json
{
   "var" string, the name of the variable where this json or string json is stored
   "path" string, the path inside json, in case of need not the root level, but
       a part inside
   "filter" string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level (after applying
          the "path"),
          it allows to filter out items in the array
            (for example: "filter": "name=='key'")
   "sort" []string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level
          (after applying "path" and "filter")
          it allows to sort the final array by some fields.
          (for example "sort": ["name","kind"]
    "afterPath" the same as "path", but applied after filtering and sorting
   "noReadOfUndefined" bool, true or false (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, an error is raised in case the path requires
          reading of undefined.
   "errorSignificant" bool, true or false, (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, the error of path is promoted as a result of the action
    "convert" string, expression to convert the source as after applying the path,
           sort and filter.
    Some optional fields for some other purposes:
    "ids" array of strings, the list of ids which identify the primary key for the following
        search inside the
    "destination" string, the place where the result must be placed for some actions
}
Example:
{"var":"JSON_SOURCE"}
