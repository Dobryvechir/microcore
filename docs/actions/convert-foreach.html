This is a part of <a href="convert-action.html">convert action</a>, so you must specify the "source"
     and may combine it with other operations. You may also use "result".
"for_each" {
     "pre_condition" string, optional, if not empty and evaluated false, the for_each is not executed
     "path" a path to find, including .*. in the path (for example, *.*.roles)
     "blocks", array of {
          "condition", string, condition to be verified
          "set", list of string, names of variables to be checked as set
          "unset", list of string, names of variables to be checked as unset
          "match", string, a variable name of another array or object to match, in this case,
                  the matching condition must be in the condition
          "item", name to present an item of the match, by default it is _item
          These 3 condition above are evaluated (each of them is optional) and depending on it the following
            assignments are performed:
          "then_to_whole", string, to be evaluated and assigned to the whole object
          "else_to_whole", string, to be evaluated and assigned to the whole object
             (if "delete" is used in expression, it means to delete this object,
              if "break" is used in expression, it means to break the loop and stop at the current position)
          "then_assign",
          "else_assign" as {
              "field" string, a field name
              "value" string, a value to be evaluated
          }
          "then_collection", collection,
          "else_collection", collection,
           where the collection is as follows:
              {
                  "source": string, name of the variable to store the collection
                  "unique": array of string, names of fields to consider the insertion as unique,
                        if empty, all data will be added in one object
                  "assign": array of {
                  "field" string, name of the field, a string constant, or if starts with "$:",
                       it is evaluated at the rest after $:
                  "value" string, to be evaluated, but if it is "delete", it is just removed
              }
              "merge_mode" int
                  this describes how to merge values if "unique" fields are the same
                  0 - replace the whole item with a new one
                  1 - append as strings with "; " as a separator
                  2 - add new subitems, replace old subitems if the keys coincide
                  3 - add new subitems, keeping old subitems if the keys coincide
                  4 - collect the minimum value as a string
                  5 - collect the maximum value as a string
              "append" true/false, if true, old values are kept in the collection which existed before
                     for_each, if false (default), the old values are cleaned
          }
     }
      Some variables which can be used in for_each:
           FOR_EACH_PATH_KEYS arrays of keys if path is used, each key is a part of the path.
           FOR_EACH_PATH_VALUES arrays of values corresponding to the keys above
   }
Explanation:
    You may choose between 3 opportunities:
    1) then_to_whole/else_to_whole if you wish to update/delete the whole object with
      which you work
    2) then_assign/else_assign if you wish to update/delete specific fields of the object with
       which you work
    3) then_collection/else_collection/append, if you with to create a new object on the basis of your
      work object (append = false) or a continue to edit a different object on the basis of your
      work object (append = true)
    You may also combile all these 3 opportunities, if it is necessary.
Example:
Task: you have an array of objects, but you want to create a different map of values.
Solution:
    1) Because you need to scan the whole array, you should specify "path":"*"
    2) for_each can create only arrays, so you need to create an array first and then
    convert it into an object.
    3) Because we need to store the result in a different object, we need to use
       then_collection/else_collection/append
    4) Because we want to create a new object each time, "append" must be false.
      This is the default for "append", so we can omit "append" at all
    5) Because we do not have any condition, we can use then_collection always and do not
      use else_connection at all.
    6) For then_collection/else_collection we do not need convert's "result", the name
      of the stored object is inside then_collection/else_collection ("source")
    7) For this example we will use only 2 fields: "id" (key - id), "name" (value), so our assignment is as follows:
      "assign": {
         "id": "id",
         "value": "name"
      }
    8) We assume we take data from variable "S" and put data to variable "D", and finally to map "M"
    9) Our primary key for those objects is "id", so
       "unique": ["id"]
