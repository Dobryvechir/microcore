<h1>call</h1>
<pre>
call executes another action, optionally with parameters, optionally returns some values
It has the parameters as follows:
{
   "action" string, name of the other action to be executed
   "params" map[string]string, optional parameters to be set for the execution of those actions
        For each key-value pair, value is considered literally, unless it starts with @.
   "result" string, optional the names of variables to be returned to the higher level
}
Normally, "action" is the name of any other valid action. There are some specific cases as follows:
   1) "action" := "return"
   In this case, the return from the current procedure is made and "result" is used
     as the result for the calling procedure
   2) "action" := "error:XXX" where XXX is http status code from 200 to 599
       the error is generated
     In this case "result" is the error message (optionally).
Example:
FIRST_ACTION_1=call:{"action":"SECOND_ACTION", "params":{"A1":"5","A2":"@map_UNIT:KEY1"},"result":"A3"}
