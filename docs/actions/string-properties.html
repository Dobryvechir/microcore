<h1>string properties</h1>
<pre>
The string properties are very simple key-value pairs
In file system .properties files they are defined as follows:
KEY_1=Value 1
KEY_2=Value 2
...
In dynamic actions they are stored as a map of strings to strings:
{
    "KEY_1": "Value 1",
    "KEY_2": "Value 2",
    ...
}
Example:
{"V1":"2","V2":"true","V3":"VV3"}
</pre>
