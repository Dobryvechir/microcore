<h1>json properties</h1>
<pre>
The json properties are key-value pairs, where key is a string and value is an
    object (or json)
In file system .properties files they are defined as follows:
KEY_1={"A1:["Value 1"]}
KEY_2=["Value 2"]
...
In dynamic actions they are stored as a map of strings to objects:
{
    "KEY_1": {
        "A1": [
           "Value 1"
        ]
    },
    "KEY_2": [
       "Value 2"
    ],
    ...
}
Example:
{"V1":["2"],"V2":{"V3":"VV3"}}
</pre>
