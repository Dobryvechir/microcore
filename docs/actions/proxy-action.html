<h1>proxy</h1>
<pre>
Proxy command has the following parameters:
{
     "url"   string, the URL (or start of URL) to be requested, starting with http: or https:
     "method" string, optional, one of the http methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,OPTIONS, HEAD, CONNECT, TRACE, PATCH
            the default is "", which means it is taken from the original request
     "headers" string, the headers of the request, semicolon-separated, optionally
          together with the headers from the original request
     "type" the Content-Type of the response. By default it is application/json
     "result" the name of the variable where to store the response
     "body" the body of the request in case is set to true. If it starts with @@, then the body will be taken from
           the variable, the name of each is specified after @@. For example, in case of "body": "@@MY_SOURCE", the body
            will be taken from the variable MY_SOURCE. If the variable does not exists, the
           action will fire 400 error (Bad parameters). If you need to ignore this error, use ? at the end.
           So, if "body":"@@MY_SOURCE?", if MY_SOURCE is not defined, the http request will be made with
          empty body and the error will not be fired. If you do not need http requests with the empty body,
           use double ? at the end. For example, in case of "body":"@@MY_SOURCE??", the http request
          will be executed only if the MY_SOURCE variable exists and it is not empty (not "", not [], not {})
    "not_proxy_body" bool, true or false (default), in case of true, the body is taken from "body" above,
          otherwise it is taken from the original request.
    "not_proxy_headers"  bool, true or false (default), in case of true, only headers
         specified in the "headers" above are used in the request, otherwise
         the headers from the original request are taken and
         if "headers" key-value pairs are defined and they overwrite the headers
         from the original request
    "not_proxy_url_params"  bool, true or false (default), in case of false
       the url parameters from the original request are added
    "not_add_url_path"  bool, true or false (default), in case of true the
       "url" above is the final url of the request, otherwise
       "url" above is used as the basis, to which the url path from the original
       request is added, and optionally (depending on "not_proxy_url_params")
       the parameters from the original request are added to the url.
    "not_return_headers"  bool, true or false (default), in case of true, the
       headers from this request are not returned back upon action execution end,
      otherwise they are returned at the end of the action execution.
}
Example:
UPDATE_STEP_1=proxy:{"url":"{{{MY_URL}}}","method":"PUT","body":"@@MY_SOURCE??"}
