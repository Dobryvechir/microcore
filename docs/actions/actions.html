Actions are supposed to implement the backend functionality
Actions are described in the configuration as follows:
{
   "name" : "unique name of the action"
   "type" : "'static'(no action is performed) | 'short'(single action defined in 'params' is executed),
            'switch':depending on conditions actions are changed, 'sse' - SSE response
            '' (default - actions are executed in sequence by properties)",
   "url" : "url of the action by which it can be executed"
   "query": {"param1":"type1:name1", "param2":"type2:name2",...}
         // param1 is the name of the parameter in url
         // type1 = string, number, boolean, ...
         // name1 is optional, it is how it is stored in variables,
         // by default name1 = "URL_PARAM_" + UpperCase(param1), all non-alpha-digital characters are replaced with "_"
   "body" :  {"path1":"type1:name1", "path2":"type2:name2",...}
         // path1 is the path of the parameter in the body's json, for example "action.0.id"
         // type1 = string, number, boolean, ...
         // name1 is optional, it is how it is stored in variables,
         // by default name1 = "BODY_PARAM_" + UpperCase(path1), all non-alpha-digital characters are replaced with "_"
         // for example:"action_0_id" 
         // this is necessary if you work only with some parts of the body,
         // in any case the whole body is saved BODY_STRING (plain text) and if it can be converted to json, 
         // also as "BODY_JSON"
   "result": "the message returned from this request, it can be of some forms, depending on the mode
   "mode": "'text' (the plain result is returned if ok) 'file'(the result contains the file name and the response is the file content)
            'var' (the variable name)"
   "params": (string) additional params to be used in specific actions. When "type" is "short", the params contains the action definition,
   "conditions": map of conditions of eligibility for this call, in case of switch, this is the switch for different conditions
               (the default action is provided by "name" itself )
   "validations": validations of input parameters
   "auth": string,
    "sse_ws": SSE info <a href="sse-action.html">Server-Sent Events</a>
}

<p>You can add your own custom actions. There are some actions available in the microcore:</p>

</ol>

    Many of the actions have a "result" field to store the result of the execution.
    The result is the variable name which must consist of latin letters (A-Z,a-z),
    the underscore (_), and digits (0-9).
    When call (if, switch, for ...) are executed, a new stack of variables is created,
    which refers to the stack of the higher level.
    The result is normally saved only on the current level. So, when you return from
    a subroutine to a higher level, this value will be abandoned.
    At the same time this value will be automatically available inside subroutines
    of all depth for the current level.
    If you wish to save the result at a higher level, you must provide the prefix with
    a colon as follows:
    1,2,3, ... saving at the higher level by this number of steps.
    request - saving at the level of the whole request
    global  - saving at the level of the global variables (this value
    will be available even in the next http requests to the server)
    Example:
      Suppose your requests calls ACTION_A, ACTION_A calls ACTION_B,
             ACTION_B calls ACTION_C, ACTION_C calls ACTION_D
      Suppose your current action step is in ACTION_C, and you set the result as follows:
         "result": "MY_RESULT"
             The value will be set as MY_RESULT and will be available for all
             action steps in ACTION_C and ACTION_D
         "result": "1:MY_RESULT"
              ACTION_B, ACTION_C, ACTION_D
         "result": "2:MY_RESULT"
              ACTION_A,ACTION_B,ACTION_C,ACTION_D
         "result": "request:MY_RESULT"
              for all in this request, that is, also
              ACTION_A,ACTION_B,ACTION_C,ACTION_D
         "result": "global:MY_RESULT"
              value will be available for all action steps and not only in this
              http request, but in all further work of the server

<pre>
    When actions are described in properties, you can set them either in short form as follows:
ACTION_B_1=net:{}
    or specifying (idle time in seconds),(pause time in seconds),(total time in seconds)
The short form above is equivalent to
ACTION_B_1=0,0,0,net:{}
You can specify a delay before executing the command (for example, 5 seconds):
ACTION_B_1=5,0,0,net:{}
You can specify parameters for repeated execution in case of failure
ACTION_B_1=5,2,10,net:{}
In the example above we make a delay of 5 seconds before the execution.
In case of failure we make a pause of 2 seconds and repeat the same.
The engine will repeat it until the success within 10 seconds. If there are no success within 10 seconds,
    the result is failure.
