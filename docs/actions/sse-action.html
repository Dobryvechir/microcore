<h1>sse</h1>
<pre>
   SSE actions must have 2 specific fields in action description ("type" and "sse-ws"):
   {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": ....
      ....

     "result" ...
     "sse_ws": {
         "delta": {
            "action_delta": string, the name of the action to verify delta
            "action_full": string, the name of the action to get the full data, if it is not the same as delta
            "action_full_result": the name of the variable where the result of the action "full" is stored
            "places": array of strings, places where changes must be tracked
         },
         "start": {
             this optional block is executed at the start of sse request
             "action": string, the name of the action to be executed
             "condition": string, optional condition to check whether it is necessary to send SSE data
             "result": string, the name of the variable where the data to be sent is stored
          },
          "mid": {
              the same structure as the "start" above, but executed each tick of the SSE session, optional
           },
          "end": {
              the same structure as the "start" above, but executed immediately before closing SSE session, optional
          },
          "interval", int, the number of time units for the tick execution
          "time_out", int, the number of time units for closing the sse event
          "heart_beat", int, the number of time units to generate heart beats when there is no data to send
          "serve_mid_at_start", bool, whether to send "mid" in place of "start", provided the "start" is
               not given, but "mid" is given
     }
   }
Example:
   {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "/api/v1/sse",
      "result": "{{RESULT}}"
      "sse_ws": {
         "delta": {
            "action_delta": "SSE_DELTA",
            "action_full": "SSE_FULL",
            "action_full_result": "SSE_FULL_RESULT",
            "places": ["0.id","pull.0.state"]
         },
         "interval": "2",
         "time_out": "240"
      }
   }
