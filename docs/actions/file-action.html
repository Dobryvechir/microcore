<h1>file</h1>
<pre>
file reads data from the local system and optionally makes some preliminary conversions
It has the parameters as follows:
{
   "name" string, the file name, it is possible to use relative paths
       it can be a list of files, with or without wild cards or regular expressions.
       Files are separated with semicolon (;). You can use wild cards (*) in the file name
       (not file path), and also regular expressions. A regular expression must start with ^
          and end with $ (which are a part of the regular expression).
        Examples: "./t/d*.txt; ./v/e^[0-9]$.txt"
   "template" bool, true or false, optional, the default is false
      if the default is true, the file is considered as the template where
      all {{{ expression }}} are evaluated and inserted
   "kind" string, one of the values as follows: (optional, the default is "json")
          "json" - the content of the file is automatically converted into json objects
          "text" - the whole content of the file as a string
          "string" - the same as the "text", but the final string is trimmed by all
                    spaces at both sides
          "remove" - files are removed. For this kind only "name" must be specified
   "path" string, optional, used for json only, the path inside json
            (for example: "path": "0.value")
   "filter" string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level (after applying
          the "path"),
          it allows to filter out items in the array
            (for example: "filter": "name=='key'")
   "sort" []string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level
          (after applying "path" and "filter")
          it allows to sort the final array by some fields.
          (for example "sort": ["name","kind"])
          If the "kind" is not "json", and multiple files are used, it is used to sort
          the original files: "asc"-acending order, "desc"- descending order
   "noReadOfUndefined" bool, true or false (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, an error is raised in case the path requires
          reading of undefined.
   "errorSignificant" bool, true or false, (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, the error of path is promoted as a result of the action
    "joiner" string, a joining string to join multiple files (if names define
          multiple files (for "kind" = "text" or "binary")
    "eol_joiner" bool true/false, if true, additional joiner as EOL is provided
          for multiple files (for "kind"="text" or "binary")
   "result" string, the name of the variable to store the result
}
Example:
READ_ACTION_1=file:{"name":"{{{DATA_PATH}}}/data.txt", "kind":"string","return":"A3"}
