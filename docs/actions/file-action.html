<h1>file</h1>
<pre>
file reads data from the local system and optionally makes some preliminary conversions
It has the parameters as follows:
{
   "name" string, the file name, it is possible to use relative paths
   "template" bool, true or false, optional, the default is false
      if the default is true, the file is considered as the template where
      all {{{ expression }}} are evaluated and inserted
   "kind" string, one of the values as follows: (optional, the default is "json")
          "json" - the content of the file is automatically converted into json objects
          "text" - the whole content of the file as a string
          "string" - the same as the "text", but the final string is trimmed by all
                    spaces at both sides
   "path" string, optional, used for json only, the path inside json
            (for example: "path": "0.value")
   "filter" string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level (after applying
          the "path"),
          it allows to filter out items in the array
            (for example: "filter": "name=='key'")
   "sort" []string, optional, used for json of array type at the first level
          (after applying "path" and "filter")
          it allows to sort the final array by some fields.
          (for example "sort": ["name","kind"]
   "noReadOfUndefined" bool, true or false (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, an error is raised in case the path requires
          reading of undefined.
   "errorSignificant" bool, true or false, (optional, the default is false)
          if it is true, the error of path is promoted as a result of the action
   "result" string, the name of the variable to store the result
}
Example:
READ_ACTION_1=file:{"name":"{{{DATA_PATH}}}/data.txt", "kind":"string","return":"A3"}
