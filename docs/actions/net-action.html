<h1>net</h1>
<pre>
Net command has the following parameters:
{
     "url"   string, the URL to be requested, starting with http: or https:
     "method" string, one of the http methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,OPTIONS, HEAD, CONNECT, TRACE, PATCH
            the default is GET
     "headers" string, the headers of the request, semicolon-separated
     "template" Object (SmartNetConfigTemplate) "template", use it only if you need to insert 
             the response into some template file
     "type" the Content-Type of the response. By default it is application/json
     "result" the name of the variable where to store the response
     "body" the body of the request. If it starts with @@, then the body will be taken from 
           the variable, the name of each is specified after @@. For example, in case of "body": "@@MY_SOURCE", the body
            will be taken from the variable MY_SOURCE. If the variable does not exists, the
           action will fire 400 error (Bad parameters). If you need to ignore this error, use ? at the end.
           So, if "body":"@@MY_SOURCE?", if MY_SOURCE is not defined, the http request will be made with
          empty body and the error will not be fired. If you do not need http requests with the empty body,
           use double ? at the end. For example, in case of "body":"@@MY_SOURCE??", the http request
          will be executed only if the MY_SOURCE variable exists and it is not empty (not "", not [], not {})
}
Example:
UPDATE_SAVE_1=net:{"url":"{{{MY_URL}}}","method":"PUT","body":"@@MY_SOURCE??"}
